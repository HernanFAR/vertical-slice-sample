# About

## Branch naming and commit messages conventions
We use the following classification to name branches and write commits. They are based on [convencional commits v1](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

For commits, the templates are like this: "[Commit type]([Related issue number]): [Commit message]". Like this:
- fix(#10): Solved SharepointAccess policy in SharepointConnectionclass
- docs(#17): Adding branch nameing and commit messages conventions in readme.md
- tools(#10): Adding MinIO support

For branches, the templates are like this: "[Branch type]/[Branch name]": Like this
- tools/readme.md-update
- tools/mailtrap-implementation
- fix/sharepoint-access-policy

The branch and commits types definitions are this:
- fix: Fixing of detected bugs in the system. Related to PATCH upgrades in the semantic versioning.
- feat: Development of new functionalities in thesystem. Related to MINOR upgrades in the semantic versioning.
- test: For commits related to testing.
- tools: For commits related to internal functionalities.
- docs: For commits related to the system documentation.
- refac: For commits related to refactorizations in the system.
- devops: For commits related to dev ops CI or CD.
